# rougelike

This is a rougelike game made in python using the ibtcodpy library as a basis.  This game can be run by cloning the repository and running main.py.  This game is fashioned in a more traditional sense in that everything is represented as purely ascii characters.  All controls are done through the keyboard.   You move and attack with the arrows keys or the numpad.  The inventory is accessed by pressig 'i'.  All other controls should be displayed on the screen.
